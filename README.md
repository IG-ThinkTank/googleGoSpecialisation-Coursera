# Getting Started with GO - Coursera Solutions

![](https://www.vertica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Golang.png)

A repository to collect my materials for the GOlang specialisation on Coursera.

### Reminder
-------------------
The reason I would like to create this repository is purely for academic use (in case for my future use).
I would be really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with you about issues related with the course even further the specific course content.

**Please only use it as a reference**. The quiz and assignments are relatively easy to answer, hope you can have fun with the courses.
